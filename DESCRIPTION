Description: The `StockDistFit` package provides functions for fitting probability distributions to stock price data. The package uses maximum likelihood estimation to find the best-fitting distribution for a given stock. It also offers a function to fit several distributions to one or more assets and compare the distribution with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and then pick the best distribution.
